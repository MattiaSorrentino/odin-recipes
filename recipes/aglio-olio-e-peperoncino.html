    <ul>
        <li>300 g spaghetti</li>
        <li>70 ml extra vergin olive oil</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
        <li>3 fresh spicy chili peppers,

        <li>2-3 tbsp chopped leaf parsley</li>
        <li>salt</li>

    <h2>How to "Spaghetti"</h2>

    <ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of  salted water to a boil. </li>
    <li>Throw in your spaghetti, and cook start cooking, frequently stirring</li>
    <li>While the pasta cooks, pour the olive oil into a pan and set over low heat. </li>
    <li>Add the garlic and chili pepper and simmer gently for a few minutes. Pay attention to the garlic and reduce the heat if necessary.
        The garlic should not burn, but fry gently.</li>
    <li>Once the pasta is cooked al dente, move it directly to the pan with the oil, the garlic and the chilli using a pair of 
        kitchen tongs, or a big fork. There will be no need to drain the pasta, and the extra water which will inevitably go in the pan will help making the sauce
    thicker and creamier.</li>
    <li>Start stirring vigorously and turn off the heat. At this point add the parsley </li>
    <li>Plate your spaghetti in a nice, large plate and serve piping hot!</li>
    <li><strong>Buon Appetito!</strong></li>
    </ol>
