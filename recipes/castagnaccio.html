    <p id="introduction">Castagnaccio is an ancient recipe, a dessert that speaks to the Tuscan peasant woman is triumph over poverty and hunger.
        The simplest version involves a basic mix of chestnut flour, water, oil and rosemary, resulting in a cake with an almost
        biting, smoky flavour and a texture similar to bread pudding. And yet castagnaccio is in some ways a surprisingly modern dessert.
        It contains no sugar and is naturally gluten and lactose-free. More elaborate versions call for dried fruit and raisins to be added
        along with its fundamental ingredient, of course: chestnut flour. Its name derives from castagna, the Italian word for chestnut.</p>
